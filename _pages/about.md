I am a PhD student in the [Artificial Intelligence for Engineering and Medicine Lab](https://aiem.jhu.edu) under supervision of professor [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) at the Johns Hopkins University. My research intresets lie primarily in Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Deep Learning. During my PhD studies, in particular, I have been working on the problem of Vehicle Re-Identification to detect vehicle instances across non-overlapping traffic cameras and developed a number of supervised and self-supervised models to solve this task.
