I am a PhD candidate in the [Artificial Intelligence for Engineering and Medicine Lab](https://aiem.jhu.edu) under supervision of professor [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/) at the Johns Hopkins University. My research intresets lie primarily in Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Machine Learning. During my PhD studies, in particular, I have been working on the problem of Vehicle Re-Identification to detect vehicle instances across non-overlapping traffic cameras and developed a number of supervised and self-supervised models to solve this task. 

Background
------
I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. Degrees in electrical engineering with the focus on Communication Systems from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. In 2018, I joined professor Chellappa's group at the University of Maryland, College Park and in 2020 I transferred to Johns Hopkins.
